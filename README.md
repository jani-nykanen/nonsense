**Nonsense** is a "rage game" for web. That's all.

## Building

Type `make js` on the terminal. It will cast dark magic and compile Javascript files. To see if it works, call `make server` (if you have python3 installed, you can also use nodejs server or whatever you want). Then go to `localhost:8000` and it should work.

If you, for an unknown reason, want to make a distributable zip file, type `make dist` (after calling `make js`, that is), and *boom*, a zip file appears!

## License

Now here's when things get tricky. Currently the license is the following:

### Code:

Do whatever you want with the code, as long as you credit the original author (me). Fork it, modify it, share it, whatever. If you, for some totally unknown reason, want to use it in a commercial product (which I don't recommend, since the code is garbage), go ahead, but you still may not claim that you wrote *all* the code yourself, that is, you need to mention the original author somewhere.

### Assets

If you modify this game, you can reuse the original assets, if you really have to, but then you need to - you guessed it! - credit the original author (me). YOU MAY NOT USE THE ASSET FILES IN A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. Except the font. Do whatever you like with the font.
